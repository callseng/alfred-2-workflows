# Volume MUTE
This workflow allows you toggle the mute state of your system volume by either:

* Keyboard Hotkey (i.e. F1 or a key combination)
* Keyword: vmute

## How & Why
This workflow runs an applescript that controls your system volume.

This is primarily useful for those of us who use non-mac keyboards but want the convenience
of keyboard shortcuts for volume control.
