# Generate Password
This workflow generates a new 15 character password using openssl rand base64.
This method produces outputs pseudo-random bytes after seeding the random number
generator once. It performs a base64 encoding on the output.

* Type 'pwd'
* New password is copied to your clipboard
* Paste new password wherever you want it.
** Make sure to save it!

## How & Why
I use 1Password for my password management and love the generate password
feature. However, I'm lazy and it takes too long to access.
